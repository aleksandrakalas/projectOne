The project is to begin as a simple mood tracker. It will ask everyday the mood of the individual and input it into the library of previous moods.

Later on developments will be made to produce statistics regarding the weekly, monthly, and yearly count ups of the moods.

Following this, activites that were done during the day can also be analyzed.

Finally a GUI to make the mood tracker interactive for the user.
